            <h1>Fawcett Comics</h1>
            <p>One of the most successful comic book publisher in the 1940's, Fawcett Publications
                  began in 1919 with the magazine, <cite>Captain Billy's Whiz Bang</cite>. Its total
                  circulation from all of its publications eventually reached over 10 million issues
                  a month.</p>
            <p>Fawcett is best known for its popular superhero, Captain Marvel, based on the
                  adventures of radio reporter Billy Batson who would turn into Captain Marvel
                  upon uttering the word <em>Shazam!</em>. Other successful characters include
                  Ibis the Invincible, Hopalong Cassidy, and Mister Scarlet. Fawcett was also known
                  for its series of horror comics including <cite>Beware! Terror Tales</cite>,
                  <cite>Worlds of Fear</cite>, and <cite>Strange Suspense Stories</cite>. The
                  company branched out into humor comic magazines with <cite>Otis and Babs</cite>
                  and <cite>Hoppy the Marvel Bunny</cite> among its most popular titles.</p>
            <p>Facing declining sales, Fawcett Comics ceased publication of its superhero
                  titles in 1953. Several of its titles were eventually sold to Charlton
                  Comics.</p>
